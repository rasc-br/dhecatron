# Dhecatron

This was used to test some features that I never used before.
Decathron was created based in a software of unknown author, that had many names: Oracle, Lucifer, Roboto, SUED, KnowAll...
It was a single file DOS executable that was spread around the 90's. A software that answer any question, with a simple trick of course.

## How to use Dhecatron

The trick to use Dhecatron is to press 'ControlLeft' key, type the answer, then press 'ControlLeft' again and type the question. It has somes phrases hardocoded that must be completed while typing the answer to looks like Dhecatron works, just hit 'ControlLeft' and start typing anything, you will understand :P

### Just a test

Since it's just a test, there is no demo or instructions to install, you can use the code on a Visual Studio Code and "npm run serve"
